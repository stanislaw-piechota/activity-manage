Django project to keep track of activity progress in highschool math class.

It operates on "five pluses rule" and "weakest first" meaning that people with the lowest number of pluses are entitled to answer first and for each 5 pluses you can get a 5 grade.
The app allows you to keep track of your progress, manage grades by teacher and check others progress to estimate who is entitled to answer
